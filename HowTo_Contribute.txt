We use GIT to manage our source code repository. If you are not familiar with GIT,
think of it like this:  If you want to submit a change, you'll need to make a "Pull Request".
 
1)  You make a branch of the code for yourself
2)  You make changes
3)  You submit your branch of code
4)  You create a Pull Request which means "you want the SWCCG community to pull in your changes"
5)  We review your changes, and merge your branch into the main branch

Here is a nice tutorial which details the steps for creating a Pull Request
